        <h3>Hello, I'm <span style="color:#779CFF;">Justin, the sound designer</span>.</h3>
        <p>I create and share sound pieces based on what I have experienced and imagined as a creator. I wish to create sounds through which you can recall your childhood days, experience the sounds of different spaces, and feel the new, undiscovered. <br><br>
    I enjoy the experience of going out and traveling alone, clearing out any thoughts, and just enjoying the sense of difference in an unfamiliar space focusing only on my feelings. I particularly enjoy closing my eyes and moving one step at a time very slowly, focusing on my surroundings, and enjoying the subtle sounds of the world. However, modern people living busy daily lives will continue being exhausting and weary, unaware of what surrounds them. Therefore, I make sounds on Miracle Night, hoping to provide experiences that may deliver relaxation from our busy world.      
        </p>
            
        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Before creating a sound,<br> I think about <span style="color:#779CFF;">the concept </span>first.</h3>
        <img src="/static/images/sd-2.png">
        <p>In the case of <span style="color:white">The Heart of the Deep Sea</span>, I recalled the untented sounds of the sea I heard while scuba diving in the Pacific Ocean of Guam. In the water, the noises of the world disappear, and you can feel your body floating without gravity, almost as if you were swimming in Outerspace. As I swam further from the life above, I looked at tropical fish and imagined a fairy tale. One in which I meet a dolphin by the coral. This memory of an imaginary scene when I was scuba diving created the story of imagining underwater scenery and encountering the dolphins.
        </p>

        <div class="manual" id="manual-1">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Do you like <span style="color:#779CFF;">imagining</span>?</h3>
        <img src="/static/images/sd-3.png">
        <p>I often take a walk in the park on dark nights and ignite my imagination. With my eyes closed in the park or forest path, I prefer to focus on the sense of sound with the smell of grass that has become thicker at night. Watch the movement of leaves and grasses, where the wind moves strongly and sometimes slowly, gently touching and shaking them. In it, I imagine that I'm in a different place and feel like I've escaped from my daily life.<br><br>
        You can also rely on comfortable sounds to face new senses and create imaginary stories. When listening to ASMR sounds and calm music, your left frontal lobe is activated, so you can experience an optimistic feeling and enlight your imagination. Listen to our sounds and refresh yourself before you go to sleep. I hope you can feel comfortable by calming down your complicated daily life so that you can go on a trip to a wonderous place after your daily life is over.<br><br>
        After going through the routine of everyday life, I hope you can find comfort and relaxation through my sounds. I hope all the listeners can relax and create their own stories based on the sounds I make and dream of a better tomorrow.
