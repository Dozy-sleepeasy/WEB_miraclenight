    <h5>When you have trouble sleeping, there are plenty of different ways that could help. Be sure to shower between one and two hours before bed, darken the room, and refrain from using electronic devices before going to bed.
    <br><br>The following is a description of one of those less-known, but effective sleep techniques. <br><br>
    <span class="highlight">Sleeping with a heavy blanket is more comfortable and helps to fall asleep?</span><br><br>
    The Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, conducted a study<span class="text-reference">1)</span> to verify this theory. 121 adults with mental issues such as insomnia and bipolar disorder were included in the study. In this study, participants were randomly grouped into two experimental groups: one group slept with a heavy blanket weighing 6 to 8 kilograms; the other group slept with a light blanket weighing 1.5 kilograms. Consequently, the rate of ISI scores decreased by more than half in the experimental bed-with-a-heavy blanket group was 59.4%, significantly higher than the rate of ISI scores reduced by more than half in the experimental bed-with-a-light blanket group (5.4%). There were significantly more individuals without insomnia in the experimental bed-with-a-heavy blanket group (42.2%) than in the experimental bed-with-a-light blanket group (3.6%).
    <br><br>
    How is that possible? This is why. It has been observed that heavy blankets increase the secretion of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. A heavy blanket triggers the cutaneous sensory nerves, the brain's sensory nucleus, and the pituitary gland when it is placed on top of our bodies. Study results have confirmed that the participants who used a blanket approximately 12% heavier than their body weight had about 32% <span class="highlight-b">higher concentrations of melatonin</span> in their bodies than those who were covered with a light blanket 2.4% heavier than their body weight.
    <br><br>
    Furthermore, it works not only for sleep. Additionally, it is reported that sleeping under a heavy duvet or blanket reduces fatigue, depression, and anxiety, as well as improves daytime activity level. 
    <br><br>
    It has become very cold these days. How about taking out the thick and heavy blanket and spending the winter under it? When you feel unable to sleep today, why don’t you try out the tips above? Possibly you’ll end up deeply falling asleep without even realizing it :)   <br><br>
