        <span class="highlight-main">Do you recall having nightmares?</span>   
    <br><br>
    It is common to refer to nightmares as dreams that are horrifying and offensive. Most people experience nightmares at least once in their lives, but children between the ages of three and six are known to have the most nightmares.
    <br><br>
    Dreams can be caused by developmental, genetic, psychological, and drug factors. The frequency of nightmares is higher when a person is young, and it decreases as he or she ages. This implies that nightmares are a natural phenomenon associated with the development of the human species. Second, there is also a genetic component. Researchers <span class="text-reference">1)</span> surveyed 241 patients who suffered from frequent nightmares and discovered that 17 of them (7.1%) had a family history of nightmares. It can therefore be concluded that nightmares are also influenced by genetic factors.
    <br><br>
    Stress plays a significant role in causing nightmares as well. In most cases, nightmares are believed to be the result of emotions experienced during the day. A lifetime of nightmares can, however, be triggered by not only everyday events but also tragic and traumatic ones like surgery, hospitalization, kidnapping, and rape. A study <span class="text-reference">2)</span> examined 26 young children who were abducted while riding a school bus and held in a freight trailer for 16 hours over a four-year period and found 25 of them had nightmares for several years.
    <br><br>
    Finally, taking medications can cause nightmares. Reserpine, levodopa, beta blockers, and digoxin are medications that may increase REM sleep and cause nightmares in individuals who do not normally experience them. In a similar manner, nightmares are experienced during alcohol withdrawal.
    <br><br>
    A nightmare can be attributed to a variety of causes, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, it is recommended to calm and reassure children who experience nightmares and to not expose them to situations that are stressful. If the symptoms are severe and they have nightmares more than twice a week and if they experience nightmares for more than 6 months, it is recommended that they undergo a psychological evaluation. <br><br>
    It is recommended that you seek professional assistance if you suffer from frequent nightmares as an adult. In a study <span class="text-reference">3)</span> conducted in Minnesota, it was found that individuals who suffer from chronic nightmares have a tendency to be suspicious, dissociated or alienated from their relationships, hypersensitive, and self-centered. Hence, people who are experiencing difficulties in interpersonal relationships are more likely to experience nightmares and vent their emotions.
    <br><br>
    You can free yourself from nightmares if you recognize what causes them. If you are having difficulty sleeping because of nightmares, why donâ€™t you try the method we have shared with you?
