    <h5>What kind of exercise should you do to sleep well?
    <br><br>
    In an interview with Johns Hopkins Dr. Gamaldo, he explains how exercises can improve your sleep quality and increase the speed at which you fall asleep.  In light of the fact that exercise has a significant impact on our quality of sleep, it would be helpful to know when and at what intensity we should exercise.
    <br><br>
    We should begin by examining how exercise increases sleep quality.
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately, there is no definitive explanation for how physical activity facilitates sleep. Nevertheless, light aerobic exercise improves the quality of our sleep, increasing the rate of deep sleep and stabilizing mood and perception. <span class="text-reference">1)</span>  A key cognitive step toward falling asleep naturally is stabilizing your mood and mind.
    <br><br>
    Then, based on the recommendations of experts, what is the right time to exercise?<br><br>
    <span class="highlight-b">Experts suggest exercising for 30 minutes a day to help you sleep better.</span> In order to obtain adequate sleep, it is important to obtain deep sleep since it allows your body and brain to heal and rejuvenate. A moderate amount of exercise is also the best sleeping pill, as exercise has an impact on the quality of our sleep on that same day.
    <br><br>
    Is there a best time to exercise?<br><br>
    Exercising right before going to sleep may make it difficult for some individuals to sleep. Why is that? We experience the benefits of aerobic exercise in part because our bodies release endorphins when we exercise. It is believed that this ingredient activates the brain and awakens us. Furthermore, exercise raises the body's temperature. When your body temperature rises, your body clock recognizes it as waking time. Ideally, you should finish exercising 1-2 hours prior to going to bed. <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">In the end, however, it is imperative that we listen to our bodies.</span>
    <br><br> 
    Depending on personal preferences, some people prefer to exercise in the morning, while others prefer to exercise in the evening. If you feel alert and energized following exercise in the morning, you may find morning exercise to be beneficial. Exercise before bed may be beneficial if you feel drowsy and tired after exercising. Regardless of the time you exercise, it can have a positive effect on your sleep, so it is recommended that you set a time that fits your schedule.
    <br><br>
    Do you find it difficult to sleep even though you are tired? Why don‚Äôt you start exercising for 30 minutes? It doesn't have to be cardio. Choosing your favorite sport, such as weightlifting or yoga, is the first step to success. Miracle Night is here to support your healthy sleep practices today. üòä
