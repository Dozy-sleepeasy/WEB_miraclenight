    <h5><span class="highlight">How would you describe melatonin to someone who does not know it?</span>
    <br><br>
    It’s a hormone that’s related to sleep. People who suffer from insomnia have become increasingly reliant on melatonin. Aside from medications, health functional foods such as jelly and tea are also available. It is commonly believed that consumption of melatonin can improve sleep because it is a natural biological hormone that induces our sleep cycle.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">Can melatonin really help us sleep? Let's take a closer look.</span>
    <br><br>
    As a hormone that regulates our circadian rhythm, melatonin is essential for sleep. As the darkness envelopes the body and the amount of light entering the eye decreases, the amount of melatonin secreted increases and sleep is induced. In this sense, melatonin is capable of managing both wakefulness and sleep whenever needed.<br><br>
    Because of its sleep-inducing properties, melatonin is also popular among individuals who suffer from insomnia. However, it was found that the effect was minimal, and there was no improvement in sleep as a result. <span class="text-reference">1)</span> People who took melatonin fell asleep 3.9 minutes earlier, and their sleep quality only increased by 2.2% compared to those who did not take it. Although melatonin can provide relief from jet lag or reset your circadian rhythm when traveling, it is limited in its ability to improve your sleep overall.       
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">So, is melatonin safe? Are there any precautions that should be taken when using it?</span>
    <br><br>
    It should be noted that although melatonin has a smaller dependence than other sleeping pills, it can have side effects if taken incorrectly.  In addition to the recommended dose of 5 mg melatonin per day, if you take it without understanding its purpose, you may experience headaches, dizziness, and nausea.<span class="text-reference">2)</span>
    <br><br>  It should also be noted that melatonin is safe when consumed in short amounts. Melatonin has not yet been independently studied in terms of its long-term effects, so doctors do not recommend using it over a long period of time due to the risk of side effects. 
    <br><br>
    What is your take to the article? If you have difficulty falling asleep or wish to improve the quality of your sleep, how about changing your lifestyle rather than relying on melatonin?  Following a regular sleep routine, exercising, and reducing caffeine intake can help improve sleep. Miracle Night is here for you once more, wishing you the best sleep ever :)
