    <h5>Dozing off. At some point, everyone has experienced being unable to overcome the feeling of drowsiness when you’re working while seated. What’s been your approach to deal with this?  
    <br><br>
    Some folks get up and walk around to wake up, some chat, and others seem to take stimulants such as coffee or caffeinated beverages. This article will discuss Nap, one of the most powerful solutions.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">How does napping benefit you? But is it really beneficial?</span><br><br>
    A ‘nap’ involves the time between lunch and dinner, as well as the time after waking up and before retiring to bed. Thus, napping is an effective method of making up for the lack of sleep experienced at night. In most cases, sleepiness is caused by a lack of adequate sleep at night. The benefits of napping include reduction of fatigue, increased alertness, and improved mood. Additionally, it improves one's reaction time and memory in addition to improving performance. There have been reports which indicate that those who slept more experienced greater performance and alertness than those who consumed caffeine or napped among folks that worked shifts.<span class="text-reference">1)</span><br><br>
    The approach can, of course, backfire. The reason for this is that it may cause sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep and being space out.<br><br> 
    What are we supposed to do for a healthy nap?<span class="text-reference">2)</span><br><br>
    <span class="highlight">First, it is best to keep nap times to a minimum.</span><br>Sleeping for between ten and twenty minutes relieves fatigue and induces a high level of arousal in our bodies. The light sleep stage allows us to wake up refreshed and without too much effort.<br><br>
    In spite of this, taking naps longer than 30 minutes is not necessarily harmful. As you enter the deep sleep stage, you will notice an improvement in cognitive abilities, such as memory and creativity, upon arising from deep sleep. The recommendation is that you give yourself a sufficient amount of time before doing other activities after waking up, or wake up according to your sleep cycle (average 90 minutes).<br><br>
    <span class="highlight">Second, take a nap in the early afternoon if possible.</span><br> Taking a nap after 3 p.m. can disrupt your sleep cycle and make it difficult for you to fall asleep at night. There is, however, no perfectly suitable time to take a nap, since each individual requires a different amount of sleep and circumstances may vary, such as sleep schedule, age, and medications taken. Therefore, it would be a good idea to schedule your rest in the early afternoon to take a nap by trying out different times.<br><br>
    
    In addition to the above methods, it is also wise to ensure that your sleep environment is dark, quiet, and consistent. A nap is an effective way to increase your productivity if you can handle it well. As long as you take adequate naps, we hope you will be able to achieve high performance and good health.
