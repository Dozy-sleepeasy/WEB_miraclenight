    <h5>A clock ticks in a room with no light source. In the pitch blackness, you feel lost and helpless. 
    <br><br>
    Have you ever had a problem sleeping? You lay down to sleep and an hour goes by and youâ€™re still wide awake. In recent years, 'blackout curtains' have been growing in popularity as more people experience difficulty falling asleep. <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">How exactly do 'blackout curtains' work? Will it actually improve the quality of our sleep?</span>
    <br><br>
    The main characteristic of blackout curtains is that they are mainly made of thick material and extend down to the floor to completely block out daylight. You can induce deep sleep by completely blocking any light that might leak through the curtains.
    <br><br>
    Even the faintest light is enough to stimulate our optic nerves. Sleep is disrupted because of the negative impact this has on the secretion of melatonin, the sleep hormone. We can easily fall asleep by completely blocking out these lights. During the day, as well as at night, blackout curtains help us wind down by blocking the bright sunlight that interrupts our sleep.
    <br><br>
    Despite the fact that blackout curtains are highly effective, they also have two disadvantages? <br><br>
    Firstly, blackout curtains block all light, preventing your body from recognizing when it is time to awaken. There is a major downside to this. This causes our sleep rhythm to be disrupted. <span class="highlight-b">Users complained of fatigue even after sleeping for a long period using blackout curtains.</span> During the morning, without natural light, our brain believes that we should remain asleep and we do not wake up naturally.

    <br><br>
    Second, as a result, if users were to rely on blackout curtains without being aware of the above risks, they would remain exhausted without knowing the cause. For this reason, it is wise to open the curtains about three to five centimeters if you intend to use blackout curtains in the future.
    <br><br>
    It is actually believed that blocking the light from smartphones and mood lamps is more effective than blocking the light from natural sources. You should review your sleeping habits and environment before using blackout curtains. By referring to the information we have provided, we hope that you will be able to discover the method that suits your needs and that you will experience faster and more satisfying sleep:)
