    <h5>Almost all Koreans enjoy drinking coffee. Every corner has a Starbucks, and we usually rush into one after a meal to get that taste of food off from our mouths. In terms of market size, the Korean coffee shop market is worth 5.4 trillion won every year, ranking third in the world after the United States and China. Don't you find it amazing?
    <br><br>
    Moreover, the average amount of coffee consumed by a person each year exceeds 400 cups. According to the statistics, individuals consume an average of three to four cups of coffee per day, even when non-coffee drinkers are excluded. This is why coffee is such an integral part of our daily lives.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight">“ I can’t give up coffee but I also need a good night’s sleep.”</span><br>
    If you enjoy drinking coffee, which is an indispensable part of modern life, please take the time to carefully read the article.
    <br><br>
    Caffeine, in the first place, is a psychoactive substance. During the 19th century, caffeine was discovered in coffee, and it functions as a natural stimulant in the central nervous system. Because it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and the central nervous system, it suppresses sleepiness. It is also a substance that is widely used legally in a variety of countries worldwide because of its efficacy, such as improving fatigue recovery and migraine reduction.
    <br><br>
    There is, however, ample evidence that caffeine consumption can adversely affect sleep, as has been reported in a number of studies. It has been demonstrated in the following study<span class="text-reference">1)</span> that caffeine usually prolongs the time for us to enter the early sleep stages, reduces one's total sleep time, reduces sleep efficiency, and significantly worsens one's sleep quality. The reduction in deep sleep also leads to an increase in the percentage of light sleep and wakefulness stages.
    <br><br>
    How can a person sleep if they drink coffee?
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">1. We need to adjust the time for the last coffee.</span> <br>
    Approximately four to six hours<span class="text-reference">2)</span> is the average time required for caffeine to be metabolized. It is therefore recommended to avoid coffee and caffeine at least four hours before bedtime. The best way to reduce caffeine's effect on sleep is to give it time to break down in your body.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">2.	Avoid drinking more than two cups of coffee per day</span> <br>
    The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety recommend that caffeine consumption be limited to 400 milligrams per day or less. When we say 400 milligrams, it is equivalent to approximately three cups of Americano and approximately two cups of cold brew. However, the maximum number of cups of coffee would be two if you include food (chocolate, green tea, energy drinks, etc.) in addition to coffee in your daily life. Caffeine in moderate amounts can minimize the effects of insomnia.
    <br><br>
    If you cannot sleep at night and keep tossing and turning, why not implement a healthy habit of drinking coffee each morning?
