    <h5><span class="highlight">The flu of the mind, depression.</span> <br><br>  There is no doubt that depression is a very familiar term in modern society. Any individual may experience gloomy days and feel depressed on occasion. Let us find out how these days and emotions affect your sleep today.
    <br><br>
    Sleep and depression are also closely related. Depression can aggravate poor sleep quality, and poor sleep quality can exacerbate depression. In many cases, this complex relationship leads to chicken or the egg causality dilemma discussions where it is difficult to determine which is the dominant cause.
    <br><br>
    Nevertheless, a research team at Oxford University recently made a significant discovery. This study <span class="text-reference">1)</span> has demonstrated that not getting adequate sleep is associated with weight gain, a greater risk of heart disease, dementia and the aging of the skin. In addition, research indicates that people who fail to get enough sleep are more likely to suffer from paranoia, depression, anxiety, and nightmares.
    <br><br>
    In the past, people with depression and other mental health problems were believed to have difficulty sleeping at night, however this study found that sleep deprivation is causally linked to mental health concerns.
    <br><br>
    A group of researchers conducted cognitive behavioral therapy to improve sleep for 3,800 sleep-deprived people, and found that  <span class="highlight-b">anxiety and depression decreased by 20%</span> as a result. In addition, their level of trust in other individuals increased, resulting in an increase in happiness of 10%.
    <br><br>
    It is, of course, impossible to conclude that sleep eliminates all external stressors completely. Sleeping well, however, can help overcome depression. At night, when you can get your own dose of alone time, lie down in bed with a chilled mind. A good night's sleep is the key to overcoming depression. Having a healthy sleep life is essential for a happy day. Miracle Night will help you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Let Miracle Night deliver a Miracle Sleep experience for you today ðŸ˜Š
