    <h5>Does neck and back discomfort keep you awake at night? There are many reasons why you may be unable to fall asleep quickly or feel refreshed after waking up, but in most cases, it is likely that both the pillow and the mattress are not designed to meet your needs. ‘What kind of pillow would suit you best?’. Could it possibly have an answer? <br><br>
    ‘What kind of pillow would suit you best?’ it’s not only determined based on height and weight. In this regard, an individual can choose the best pillow after taking into account his usual sleeping position, environment, and personal preferences. While <span class="highlight-b">‘preference’</span> may be surprising to people in search of a scientific method, the discomfort experienced just before and while sleeping has a major impact on the quality of sleep.
    <br><br>
    First and foremost, let's determine whether you prefer a feather pillow or a firm foam pillow. Please make sure that the pillow that you choose does not interfere with the use of a negative pressure device if you are requiring one due to a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea.
    <br><br>
        You should also consider your <span class="highlight-b">sleeping position</span>.<br>
    1.	You should use a pillow that is low enough to prevent your neck from being twisted when you sleep upright with your back on the floor or on your stomach. In addition to placing stress on your neck, using a pillow that bends so much will also result in you snoring.<span class="text-reference">1)</span><br>
    2.	The best pillow for side sleepers is one that covers your shoulder width. The height of your neck will be in line with the spine of your body if your shoulder is supported stably on a pillow.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight">Adjusting the pillow height is generally intended to help keep your spine aligned.</span> <br><br>
    In order to benefit from our body's natural ability to rest and recover during sleep, we must maintain an S shape, which is the most natural form of protection for the body. Hopefully you will select the pillow that is most suitable for you and be able to achieve good health in the near future. :)

      1) In fact, we don't recommend sleeping on your front. This is because lying on your stomach can increase the risk of glaucoma by raising the intraocular pressure, and a slight disturbance in the posture may put pressure on the spine. <br>
