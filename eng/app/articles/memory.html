    <h5>Have you ever crammed for a test the night before? Many students cram for better grades by sleeping less and studying more.
    <br><br> However, what if sleeping better was associated with better performance on exams?  It is believed that our memory is strengthened in three stages.
    <br><br>
    The first step in learning something new is the <span class="highlight-b">encoding</span> phase. It involves accepting or registering for a short period of time the stimuli received from one or more of the senses.  <span class="highlight-b">Consolidation</span> stage, during this stage of the learning process, the newly acquired knowledge is strengthened and rearranged.  Finally, in the <span class="highlight-b">retrieval</span> stage, the learned information is retrieved.  Memory can be strengthened with a good night's sleep.  
    <br><br>
    In non-REM sleep (stages 1-3) and REM sleep, the consolidation stage occurs where important memories are stored and unnecessary information is discarded. As an adult, we go through four stages of sleep throughout the night, the first two are light sleep, the third is deep sleep. light sleep prepares our brains for a new day of learning. In other words, not getting enough sleep is detrimental to our ability to learn by 40%.
    <br><br>
    In addition, during this stage of non-REM sleep, our memories from the previous day are sorted out and data that is important and non-important is discarded. When deep sleep progresses and REM sleep also occurs, this filtered information becomes stronger.       
    <br><br>
    A study conducted in 2003 examined <span class="text-reference">1)</span> the process of consolidation. Participants in the study underwent language training in the morning, evening, and the following day in order to determine whether their abilities changed. Following training, they demonstrated significant improvements in their language skills, however, the effects diminished as the day progressed. However, after enough sleep, the individuals reported having regained their memories.    We found that sleep can assist us in consolidating and retrieving information.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">Your brain needs sufficient sleep to store the knowledge you have gained.</span><br><br>  
    Today, we covered the mechanism by which we acquire, store, and recall newly acquired information through sleep. Are you familiar with the experience of being unable to sleep before an exam because of stress or worry? Why don’t you keep the information from this article as future reference, and make sure to study beforehand? It is our wish that you will succeed in all your tests, and we hope that a good night's sleep will allow you to feel refreshed.
