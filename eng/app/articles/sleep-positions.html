    <br><br>
    Sleepers are known to change positions between 20 and 40 times during sleep, and stay in one position for an average of 15 minutes. Furthermore, each individual has a specific sleeping position they prefer. In other words, will the position in which we sleep affect the quality of our sleep? Today, we'll examine the relationship between sleeping position and sleep quality.
    <br><br>
    It’s quite interesting to know that there have been research efforts on this topic as far back as 1983.
    <br><br>
    Using 8 good sleepers and 8 poor sleepers, Canadian psychologists analyzed how sleep position is related to sleep quality. We will explain in this section how there are standards that apply to people who have good and poor sleep. Good sleepers are those who fall asleep within 10 minutes, don't wake up during the night, and have no difficulty falling and staying asleep. It refers to individuals who are satisfied with the quality of their sleep. As a contrast, individuals who are having difficulty sleeping are those who take more than 60 minutes to fall asleep and who wake up more than once during the course of the night. Other words, these individuals have a poor sleeping pattern. Considering this, what can be said about those who sleep well and those who do not?
    <br><br>
    Research has demonstrated that poor sleepers, on average, change positions significantly more often than those who get enough sleep. A more interesting finding was that those who did not get enough sleep often slept on their backs in bed with their heads straightened. The researchers found they remained in this position twice as long as those who had good sleep, for instance for more than 30 minutes.
    <br><br>
    Those who had good sleep, on the other hand, reported sleeping much of the time on their sides, avoiding lying on their backs with their heads upright.
    <br><br>
    Several studies have shown that people's sleeping position can contribute to sleep disorders such as breathing problems (and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea) or back problems. People suffering from sleep disorders may find that lying on their back makes it even more difficult to fall asleep. It is believed that this posture can block the upper airway and cause back injury (pressure on the spine). In contrast, sleeping on your side, often a preferred position by good sleepers, places less pressure on the spine, ergo does not cause back pain. It is also thought to be helpful in reducing snoring and sleep apnea.
    <br><br>
    Today, we examined the sleeping positions of good and poor sleepers, as well as how each can impact the quality and quantity of sleep we get. Despite this, there is still a lack of research evidence establishing a relationship between sleeping posture and nighttime sleep quality. Research relating to sleeping postures in the future will yield more interesting results.<br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">It is incredibly important to find a sleeping position that is compatible with your body type.</span><br><br>
    For folks who are unable to sleep due to back pain or apnea, it is recommended that they lie on their side during the night. For those who suffer from hip or knee pain, lying on their back is recommended. Do you normally sleep well? If you are not happy with the quality of sleep you’re getting, why not try changing your posture tonight?
