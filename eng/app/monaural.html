        <h3>How did you <span style="color:#779CFF;">sleep</span> last night?</h3>
        <p>Do you remember what you heard around you? Someone might have fallen asleep while listening to YouTube sleep-inducing sounds. Someone might have fallen asleep listening to the sound of cars passing by from afar. In today's world, where most people live in cities, few people seem to fall asleep in a quiet, silent environment. Sound is something that has always been with our sleep. </p>
            
        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">How can <span style="color:#779CFF;">sound affect sleep</span>?</h3>
        <p>To be more precise, are they helping you fall asleep? Surprisingly, we don't know the scientific causality of whether most sounds help us sleep. So is the sleep music without sufficient evidence or controlled experiments. This is quite remarkable in a world of 'smart' where you can access technology so easily.  </p>
        <p>The Miracle Night team has not stopped researching for the past two years to develop sound that is scientifically effective in inducing people to sleep. And finally, we developed a 'scientific' sound of sleep that you can hear 'easily'. "Layered Monoral Beat" by Miracle Night. Let me introduce you to what this is and how it works.  </p>

        <h3><span style="border-left: 2px solid #fff; padding-left: 10px;">Brainwaves</span></h3>
        <img src="/eng/static/images/mb-science-1-eng.png">
        <p>You may have heard about brainwaves. Brainwaves are the electrical pulses of neuro-activities between groups of neurons in your brain. Your brain produces five different kinds of brain waves, each operating at a different speed, including gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta waves. When we sleep, we usually produce low waves from delta to alpha waves. A very important theory is to be noted here. Our brain waves tend to be induced to a particular frequency from the specific rhythms that we hear. This phenomenon is called brainwave entrainment.
</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="manual-2" id="manual-1" style="margin-top: 60px;">
        <h3><span style="border-left: 2px solid #fff; padding-left: 10px;">Brainwave Entrainment</span></h3>
        <img src="/static/images/mona-3.png">
        <p>Brainwave entrainment is the synchronization of brain waves to a particular frequency. Entrainment is utilized in various sectors, and one that we are going to explore is when we sleep. By synchronizing your brain waves to low-range waves like delta, your brain will produce electrical pulses at a lower rate, leading you to a deep sleep state. This thesis is has been tested and proven by many scientists for over 60 years. </p>
        <p>We can find one example of such in an article that examined the relation between brainwave entrainment and sleep. It found that using brainwave entrainment, the subjects were able to increase the quality of sleep 1). Also other articles also proved that brainwave entrainment can be used as a therapy for insomnia 2) and contribute to sleep induction 3).</p>
        <p>However, brainwave entrainment does not happen by simply listening to a frequency of sound waves. For a brain to be synchronized to a certain frequency, a person needs to listen to a combination of sound waves of that frequency.  Thus, our team produced this combination that induces your brainwaves to low-range waves by using Monaural Beats.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="manual-2" id="manual-1" style="margin-top: 60px;">
        <h3><span style="border-left: 2px solid #fff; padding-left: 10px;">Monaural Beats</span></h3>
        <img src="/eng/static/images/mb-science-3-eng.png">
        <p>We are almost there! And this is the most critical part of the science here. There are three ways of making sound waves that effectively induce your brain waves. They are Monaural beats, Binaural beats, and Isochronic tones. They have different features that make them suit for different situations. Here is a brief table of why we chose Monaural beats.</p>
            
        <img src="/eng/static/images/mona-5-eng.png">
        <p>Binaural beats work only if you listen to different frequencies for two ears, so you will have to wear earphones to enjoy the effects. However, we all know that using earphones throughout sleep is not good for your ear. Also, isochronic tones are a little bothersome to be used for sleep sounds. Thus, we chose Monaural Beats that are effective without any help from additional devices and relatively relaxing sounds. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="manual-2" id="manual-1" style="margin-top: 60px;">
        <h3><span style="border-left: 2px solid #fff; padding-left: 10px;">Layered Monaural Beats</span></h3>
        <p>We did not stop; we continued to research. We wanted to provide the best Monaural beats. We collaborated with Brain & Cognitive Science lab at Yonsei University to go through a series of experiments and clinical trials to find the most effective way of inducing the brainwaves into sleep. In the process, we found a mixing algorithm that produced the Monaural beats much stronger than the regular Monaural beats. We call this "Layered Monaural Beats.”</p>
        <img src="/static/images/mona-6.png">

        <p>So, by how much do our Layered Monaural Beats help you sleep better? One of our experiments proved that delta waves went up by 18% with Layered Monaural Beats compared to the controlled condition. In fact, one subject even experienced over 28% delta waves increment in just 5 minutes. Since this algorithm is developed exclusively by our team, it is protected by patents.

        <p>I first decided to write this article to explain how our science works. However, through this long article, I hope I have delivered the sincerity of our dedication to solving sleep problems to you. Our team members, consisting of PhDs and experienced engineers, gathered with a shared experience – the sleepless nights that entailed painful sufferings of insomnia and sleeping pills. We are dead serious, passionate, and professional. You will eventually know that we are the only team that will change the world's paradigm of sleep. We will make sleep much easier and better. Thank you for staying with me till this very last sentence.</p><p>
