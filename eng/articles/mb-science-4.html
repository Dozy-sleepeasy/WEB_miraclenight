    <h5>Oops, first day of school is not far away! Or do you have to get up early for work again tomorrow? Just hearing the words makes your head throbbing already. <br><br>
    How do you relieve your stress? 
    <br><br>
    Some people watch YouTube videos, listen to their favorite music, or burn incense to clear their head and feel better. There are other ways to do this, such as exercising or talking with friends. We relieve stress and gain peace of mind these ways.
    <br><br>
    Scientifically, if you do the above, serotonin-—which eliminates depression-—increases, and beta-endorphin—-which enhances happiness-—increases to reduce stress. However, the problem is that this method requires our concentration, affects our thoughts and emotions, and may have risk factors such as allergies and side effects. Then, what is the way to increase 'relaxation' with minimal stimulation?
    <br><br>
    We spent such a long time to find the solution for this. And the answer was to provide a sound wave without any interesting content or melody. These vibrations are like the effect of giving a massage to the brain. So if you can give the brain a sense of stability by giving the right waves, it's perfect. In general, delta waves are dominant during deep sleep, alpha waves are dominant in the state of awakening and rest, and theta waves are predominantly observed when quietly concentrated. If so, wouldn't it be possible to make users feel a deep sense of security if we could induce ‘delta waves‘ which comes out during the deep sleep stage?
    <br><br>
    As a result of testing both providing the frequencies listed above and giving no sound at all, it was found that users felt most stable when delta waves were heard.<span class="text-reference">1)</span> There were even people who said they felt only stable with just delta waves. That's how strong the stability of the delta wave is.
    <br><br>
        
    Also, there was a response saying that he/she felt pressure when listening to theta waves. Theta waves are dominant during REM sleep, which is the next stage of deep sleep, and they appear at the end of the sleep cycle. So it seems quite unnatural to induce theta waves to dominate from the beginning.
    <br><br>
    In this article, we looked into the effect of feeling stable through brainwave entrainment. If you want to find peace again after having fun or going through an unfortunate event, why not listen to delta waves, which are a little less stimulating but sure to have an effect? We hope that you will save time and take care of your health with the most reliable and guaranteed effect. :)
