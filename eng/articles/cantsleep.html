    <h5>How many times have you spent the night tossing and turning because you couldn't sleep? <br><br>  If you’ve been searching for the answer to fall asleep quickly at night, you have come to the right place :) We’ll share a few no-fail tips so that you can meet Morpheus in no time.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">1. Keep a regular biorhythm</span> <br>
    In general, what time do you go to bed and when do you wake up? When you go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, your circadian rhythm is kept regular. The ability to fall asleep more quickly can be achieved by maintaining a consistent circadian rhythm.  
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">2. Expose yourself to both light and darkness</span> <br>
    Whether we are asleep or awake is influenced greatly by light and darkness. As soon as our bodies encounter light, they recognize that it is time to wake up, and when they are exposed to darkness, they recognize that it is time to sleep. The easiest way to fall asleep is to keep your room dark at night, and have plenty of light in the day to help keep you awake.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">3. Take up yoga or meditation</span> <br>
    Our bodies have difficulty falling asleep when we are stressed out. In contrast, yoga prevents and relieves stress and tension by utilizing breathing patterns and body movements. The practice of meditation increases the production of the hormone melatonin, which greatly enhances our ability to fall asleep. Using mindfulness to fall asleep assists you in staying focused on the present and reduces worry as you fall asleep.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">4. Let go of your desire to sleep</span> <br>
    In some instances, lying in bed and waiting to fall asleep can have the exact opposite effect of not being able to sleep. Stress and anxiety associated with not being able to sleep can lead us to negative thoughts and keep us from falling asleep. Alleviate the pressure of needing to sleep. If your mind is relaxed, it will be much easier for you to fall asleep.  
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">5. Take time to reflect on the things that make you happy</span> <br>
    <span class="text-reference">1)</span>The method of associating images helps people fall asleep faster, since we fall asleep with happy thoughts. According to a well-known belief, the more positive thoughts we have, the more comfortable our body and mind become, and this makes it easier for us to fall asleep.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-main">6. Embrace monaural beats that promote sleep.</span> <br>
    Do you know that there are professional and scientific sounds that induce sleep? Monaural beats can be used to tune our brainwaves into deep sleep delta waves. (Delta waves are the frequencies we usually observe when we are asleep.) 
    Those who have difficulty falling asleep or wish to sleep more deeply and faster should <span class="highlight-b">try Miracle Night, which provides monoaural beats right to your ears.</span>

    So far, we have shared with you a few ways to fall asleep quickly when you cannot sleep at night. Having a regular sleep pattern and a relaxed state of mind is the most important aspect of sleep. However, maintaining this state on a daily basis can be difficult.   Wouldn't it be interesting if we could fall asleep easily every day with just scientific sounds, regardless of our state of mind? 
    <br><br>
    For those who wish to sleep soundly, <span class="highlight-b">Miracle Night offers you a miraculous sleep experience. </span>
